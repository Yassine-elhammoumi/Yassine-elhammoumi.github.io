      <description>Second CTF in the longest module for the Penetration testing student course, This time we have two machines; target1.ine.local &amp;amp; target2.ine.local. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what flags we need to capture :&#xA;Flag 1: Enumerate the open port using Metasploit, and inspect the RSYNC banner closely; it might reveal something interesting. Flag 2: The files on the RSYNC server hold valuable information. Explore the contents to find the flag. Flag 3: Try exploiting the webapp to gain a shell using Metasploit on target2.</description>

      <description>It has been a while since I went back to my ejpt course because I felt it becoming a little repetitive, but lately I had some free time and decided to tackle it again. And today, I am going to do a walkthrough for the Host &amp;amp; Network Penetration Testing: The Metasploit Framework CTF 1.&#xA;This time we are provided with a windows machine (since we&amp;rsquo;re told to exploit an MSSQL server) and we have 4 flags to capture :</description>

      <description>Continuing on with my eJPT certification, this time we&amp;rsquo;ll tackle the second CTF in the System-Host Based Attacks course.&#xA;In this lab we&amp;rsquo;re provided with two machine; target-1 and target-2. And we have 4 flags to capture :&#xA;Flag 1: Check the root (&amp;rsquo;/&amp;rsquo;) directory for a file that might hold the key to the first flag on target1.ine.local. Flag 2: In the server&amp;rsquo;s root directory, there might be something hidden.</description>

      <description>Today, a second CTF walkthrough for the System-Host Based Attacks CTF 1. This time we have 4 flags :&#xA;Flag 1: User &amp;lsquo;bob&amp;rsquo; might not have chosen a strong password. Try common passwords to gain access to the server where the flag is located. (target1.ine.local) Flag 2: Valuable files are often on the C: drive. Explore it thoroughly. (target1.ine.local) Flag 3: By attempting to guess SMB user credentials, you may uncover important information that could lead you to the next flag.</description>

      <title>Shellshock : Explanation &#43; Demonstration (CVE-2014-6271)</title>

      <description>What is Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271)? Basically, Shellshock is a critical vulnerability in Bash (versions 1.03 through 4.3) that allows attackers to perform arbitrary commands executions due to a flaw in Bash&amp;rsquo;s handling of environment variables.&#xA;Environment variables ? Environment variables are a simple way to pass about the current operating environment to the program being executed. You can define one simply by typing :&#xA;variable=&amp;#34;test&amp;#34; And you can use it as you would use a variable in a programming language.</description>

      <title>walkthrough : Assessment Methodologies: Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1 (INE - eJPT)</title>

      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to write about my attempt at solving the &amp;ldquo;Assessment Methodologies: Vulnerability Assessment CTF 1&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Before trying to capture any flags, I started by doing a quick nmap scan on the local network to identify the target.&#xA;We can see that the ports 80 and 3306 are open on the host&amp;rsquo;s IP 192.194.77.3 so it must be our target (the target.ine.local helps too).&#xA;I then opened the browser to look at the web server (since port 80 is open) and I found an OWASP app.</description>
