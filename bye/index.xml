      <description>This is a good bye message, I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet who&amp;rsquo;s receiving it, I know how tho, my dead man switch is pretty sweet (last time i tried i didn&amp;rsquo;t have one and that sucked ass). I was thinking of making a more elaborate plan but simple will have to do.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with mental health lately, I would spend entire days without talking to anyone in real life, not by choice mind you, I just literally don&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to talk to and everyone I&amp;rsquo;d talk to online wouldn&amp;rsquo;t care (not like I had online friends or anything, m talking about my girlfriend and my mom lol)</description>
