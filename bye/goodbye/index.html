                <p>This is a good bye message, I don&rsquo;t know yet who&rsquo;s receiving it, I know how tho, my dead man switch is pretty sweet (last time i tried i didn&rsquo;t have one and that sucked ass). I was thinking of making a more elaborate plan but simple will have to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling with mental health lately, I would spend entire days without talking to anyone in real life, not by choice mind you, I just literally don&rsquo;t have anyone to talk to and everyone I&rsquo;d talk to online wouldn&rsquo;t care (not like I had online friends or anything, m talking about my girlfriend and my mom lol)</p>
<p>The only thought that goes through my brain now, whenever I try to do anything is : why bother, I&rsquo;ll be dead soon anyways. And it&rsquo;s a really comforting thought.</p>
<p>I am a weak person, I can&rsquo;t handle life and I apologize for everyone i disappoint with my decision. I can&rsquo;t claim it was a hard one to make, because i have no alternatives. I don&rsquo;t have anything to look forward to in life; everything i care about i end up screwing it up. Anyways</p>
<p>Been feeling like a prisoner in my own room, so might as well be on deathrow and get done with it.</p>
<p>My lovely girlfriend will most probably be the only one receiving this and i want her to know that i loved her and that she meant the world to me and that she should see this as a chance for her to find a better partner, whorty of her and her love and m sure she will because she&rsquo;s awesome like that and anyone who&rsquo;d end up with her will be the luckiest man alive.</p>
<p>I leave you with this meme :</p>
